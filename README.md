To use the app, a user will first have to create an account using a username, email, and password. He can then sign in thereafter using the username and password. 

The user, once signed in, has access to a public library of workouts and exercises. 
He can use these exercises, or make new personal exercises, to  create new personal workouts. 

A Workout is a routine of exercises that the user is expected to do repeatedly and regularly. When making a workout, the user can specify the number of sets (optional), number of reps (optional), and estimated duration of the exercise.
